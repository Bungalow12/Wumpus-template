# Hunt the Wumpus Template
## About
Hunt the Wumpus is a game from 1973 (See [Hunt The Wumpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus)).
This project template is an easy base setup for a Hunt the Wumpus project for the Microsoft Hunt the Wumpus 
program for high school students in the Greater Seattle Area. 

In this program mentor volunteers, typically current and previous Microsoft employees and those students who
had once participated in the project. The goal to provide a fun team-based software development experience to
build a game by having several students on different components of the game while following a basic game specification.

This culminates in an end of year competition where students show off the projects.
