# Hunt the Wumpus Game UI

## About

This project template is an easy base setup for a Hunt the Wumpus project to be built as a web-based application
using whatever technologies the team decides to use. The base presentation layer is using React with 
[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) wrapped as React Components.

### What is React
Not to thing too much about it React is a server-side rendering platform. Instead of just having a simple HTML
page with all the code available to the end user, React is a system that allows the code behind the application 
to be processed on the server instead of the user's computer. This is more secure but also allows experiences 
to easily change by reacting to user input and events.

### What is ThreeJS
ThreeJS is a WebGL based rendering engine allowing for 3D and 2D games in the browser.

### What is React Three Fiber
A package creating React Component Wrappers for ThreeJS allowing for building yur scenes directly in React.
